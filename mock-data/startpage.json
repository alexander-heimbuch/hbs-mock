But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! No! Don't jump! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</p>",

Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as \"the brig\". I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p><ul><li>Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin?

You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.</p><h4>Obsoletely Fabulous</h4><p>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Who are you, my warranty?! She also liked to shut up! With gusto. Shut up and get to the point!</p>"
